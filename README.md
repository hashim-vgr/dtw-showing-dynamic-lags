DTW is a method to quantify the similarity between two time series or sequences exhibiting a certain likeness but may vary in speed and amplitude. 

DTW can be used to calculate the similarites between 2 times series.

But here i'm showing how to use it to calculate the dynamic lags between two time series signals.
 ## what are dynamic lags?

like the image shown above, dynamic lags give information on wether a current sample is leading of lagging correspoinding to it's counterpart in the other signal.
